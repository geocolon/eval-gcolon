# Take a look at this sample react code
##
The sample code contains a list of names. Add functionality to allow a user to
filter based on a pattern and select names to display on the adjoining area marked selected names.

- Create a fork from the code challenge repo and commit your changes there. Issue a pull request when ready.

- Review sample code and refactor to a desired component group.

- Add functionality to toggle selected names and display below in "Selected Names" section.

- Add filter field above checkbox list and filter visible options based on matching characters.

- Implement state management using redux as needed.

- Review sample code and refactor to improve code quality.


This set of tasks should take no more than 3 hours.
